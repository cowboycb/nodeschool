If the package learnyounode which has these workshops is wanted to be run locally then these commands should be used (in Linux):

```shell
npm install learnyounode
# in .bashrc file put this code block and save 
npm-run(){
 $(npm bin)/$*
}

# "npm bin" command finds the nearest nodejs bin folder 
```
